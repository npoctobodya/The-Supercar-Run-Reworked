This mod is based on _mRally2's mod 'The Supercar Run' and fixes some bugs and adds new features.

Some of main features:
- You drive only tier 6 cars; gas stations, garages and other car selections have only tier 6 cars as well
- Opponents drive tier 4 cars but with tier 6's performance
- Adjusted time events
- Fixed the text where the car tier should be 'Tier 6' instead of 'Tier 4' or 'Tier 5'

- Fixed challenge series car swap, now it's not affected at all
